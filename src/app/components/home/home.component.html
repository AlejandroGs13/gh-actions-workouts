<h1>What is GitHub Actions?</h1>
<p>
  <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> is a CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that
  enables you to automate workflows directly within your repository. With it,
  you can configure tasks to run automatically in response to events such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Push</strong>: When code is pushed to a repository.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pull Request</strong>: When a pull request is opened, updated, or
    merged.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: On a defined schedule (e.g., daily tasks).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manual</strong>: Trigger workflows manually from the Actions tab.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<p>
  1. <strong>Custom Automation</strong>: Write your own scripts and configure
  specific workflows for your project.
</p>
<p>
  2. <strong>Event Triggers</strong>: Automate tasks in response to events like
  code commits, issue creation, or releases.
</p>
<p>3. <strong>Flexible Execution Environments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Supports <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, <strong>Windows</strong>, and
    <strong>macOS</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>Container support (Docker) for replicating specific setups.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  4. <strong>GitHub Ecosystem Integration</strong>: Direct access to repository
  data, secrets, and configurations.
</p>

<h2>Why Use GitHub Actions?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong>: Automatically test your
    application with every code update.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous Deployment (CD)</strong>: Deploy your app to production
    or testing environments automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automate Repetitive Tasks</strong>: Examples include updating
    dependencies, linting, and formatting code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>YAML-based Pipelines</strong>: Easy to understand and share
    configuration files within your repository.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
  1. <strong>Workflows</strong>: Sets of automations defined in YAML files
  within the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory. Each workflow describes
  a process, like a CI/CD pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  2. <strong>Jobs</strong>: Groups of steps that run in the same environment.
  Jobs in a workflow can run in parallel or sequentially.
</p>
<p>
  3. <strong>Steps</strong>: Individual tasks within a job. These can be custom
  commands or prebuilt actions.
</p>
<p>
  4. <strong>Actions</strong>: Reusable units of work within steps. You can use
  predefined actions or create your own.
</p>

<h2>Simple Workflow Example</h2>
<br>
<pre>
<code>name: CI Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout&#64;v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node&#64;v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test</code>
</pre>
<br>
<p>This example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Runs on every <code>push</code> to the <code>main</code> branch.</li>
  <li>
    Performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
      <li>Clones the repository (checkout).</li>
      <li>Sets up Node.js.</li>
      <li>Installs dependencies.</li>
      <li>Runs automated tests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Native Integration with GitHub</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Easy Setup</strong> using predefined templates.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extensive Community and Marketplace</strong> with reusable actions.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong> for projects of all sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Marketplace</h2>
<p>
  GitHub Actions has a marketplace where you can find thousands of prebuilt
  actions ready to use, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automating deployments.</li>
  <li>Integrating linting tools.</li>
  <li>Managing dependencies.</li>
  <li>Sending notifications to Slack or Discord.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With GitHub Actions, you can easily set up CI/CD pipelines and automate
  essential workflows for your project.
